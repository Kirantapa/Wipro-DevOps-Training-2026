operators' 
==========

	Ø What is operators 
	Ø Operator in python are special 

Examples 
A = 10
B = 20
C = a+b


Conditional Statements 
======================

	Ø Conditional statements allow a program to make decisions  based on conditions 
	Ø The program executes different blocks of code depending on whether a condition is True or False 

Real time analogy
=================

	Ø If it rains >> take umbrella 
	Ø Else  >> don’t take umbrella


Why do we need conditional statements?
======================================

	Ø Control the flow of execution 
	Ø implement decision-making logic
	Ø Validate user input
	Ø Apply business rules
	Ø Build real-world app's

Types of conditional
====================

	1. If
	2. If else
	3. If elif else


	1. If
=======

	Ø It will execute code only if the condition is true


age = 20
if age >= 18:
  print("you are an adult")
  print("you can vote")
  print("you have full legal rights")



number = 15
if number > 0:
  print("the number is positive")


	2. If else 
============

	Ø  it will execute one block if condition is true, otherwise it will execute else block


a = 200
b = 33
if b > a:
  print("b is greater than a")
else:
  print("b is not great than a")



number  = 7
if number % 2 == 0:
  print("the number is even")
else:
  print ("the number is add")


	3. If elif else
=================

	Ø It will use for when multiple conditions need to be checked


score = 75
if score >= 90:
  print ("Grade A")
elif score >= 80:
  print ("Grade B")
elif score >= 70:
  print ("Grade C")
elif score >= 60:
  print ("Grade D")


a = 33
b = 33
if b > a:
  print("b is greater than a")
elif a == b:
  print("a and b are equal")


Loops
=====

	Ø A  loop in python is a control statement  used to execute a block of code repeatedly until a condition is satisfied  or for each  item in a sequence 
	Ø Loops are helping us to avoid writing same code again and again.

	1. For loop
	2. While loop


	1. For loop
=============

	Ø A for loop is used to iterate over a sequence 


fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for x in fruits:
  print(x)


for i in range (1, 6):
  print(i)

	2. While loop
===============

	Ø A while loop is a control structure used to repeat a block of code as long as a condition is true
	Ø The loop keeps running until the condition become false


Why ?
======

	Ø We don’t know in advance how many times the loop should run
	Ø We want to repeat ana action until a condition is met
	Ø We are waiting for user input or specific result

Ex-sitautions
=============

	Ø Asking the user to enter a correct passwd
	Ø Running a program until user chooses to exit
	Ø Counting until a certain value is reached



i = 1
while i <= 5:
  print (i)
  i += 1


password = ""
while password != "admin123":
  password = input("Enter password: ")
print("access granted")



pin = 0
while pin != 1234:
  pin = int(input("enter your atm pin"))
print("pin verified. transaction successful.")

  Control statements 
==================

	Ø Control statements are using to decide the flow of execution of a python program 
	Ø It will control which code runs, how many times it runs and when it stops


	1. Break  statement 
=====================

	Ø The break statement is used to immediately stop a loop, even if the loop condition is still true.

Why ?
=====

	Ø We want to exit a loop ealry
	Ø A required condition is met
	Ø An error or stopping point occurs


# stop loop when number is found
numbers = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]
for n in numbers:
  if n == 7:
    break
  print (n)


# atm pin verification 
while True:
  pin = int(input("enter atm pin: "))
  if pin == 1234:
    print("pin verified")
    break

	2. Continue statement 
=======================

	Ø The continue statement is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and to move to the next iteration.

Why?
===

	Ø We want to skip specific values
	Ø We don’t want to stop the loop
	Ø We want to ignore invalid data



# skip number 3
for i in range (1, 6):
  if i == 3:
    continue 
  print(i)


# skip invalid records 
ages = [25, -1, 30, -5, 40]
for age in ages:
  if age < 0:
    continue 
  print("valid age:", age)


	3. Pass statement 
==================

	Ø The pass statement is a null operation 
	Ø It does nothing and is used as a placeholder 

Why?
====

	Ø Code is not yet implemented 
	Ø Syntax is requires statement 
	Ø We want to avoid errors


for i in range(1, 4):
  if i == 2:
    pass
  print(i)
