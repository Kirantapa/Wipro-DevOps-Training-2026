Wt is python?
==========

	Ø It is a high-level , interpreted, general-purpose programming lng
	Ø Python has simplicity, readability and rapid development 
	Ø It was designed so that humans  can read n write code easily.

Who developed python?
=================

	Ø Python was created by Guido van Rossum
	Ø First release in 1991
	Ø Named after monty python , not the snake


Why python is popular?
=================

	Ø Easy to learn
	Ø Simple english like syntax
	Ø Less code compared to other langs
	Ø Huge community support
	Ø Massive library ecosystem
	Ø Work on all OS

	Ø Automation & scripting 
	Ø DevOps & cloud computing 
	Ø Data science & analytics 
	Ø AI & ML
	Ø Cyber security
	Ø Game development 

Features of python 
=============

	1. Simple & Readable :- no curly  braces {}, uses indentation 
	2. Interpreted language:- code is executed line by line , no compilation step
	3. Dynamically typed:- no need to declare data types explicitly 
	4. Platform independent:- same code runs on w-os, linux-os and macos
	5. Open source :- free to use and distribute 

Python language levels
=================

	1. Low level:- close to hardware 
	2. High-level :- human-readable

Python versions
============

	Ø Python 2 :- deprecated 
	Ø Python 3 :- current & recommended 
	Ø Always use python 3

Python execution model
==================

	1. Write python code (.py)
	2. Python interpreter reads the code
	3. Code is converted into bytecode
	4. Bytecode is executed by python vm
	5. Output is produced 

Wt is an interpreter?
===============

	Ø Executes code line by line
	Ø Stops execution if any error occurs 
	Ø Helps in easy debugging

Python keywords 
============

	Ø Keywords are reserved words that have special meaning

Examples :
========

If
Else
Elif
For
While
Def
Class
Try
Except 
Break
Finally
False
True
With
None
Nor
Or
And
Return
Continue 
Pass
Hash
Import
Raise
Yield 
Global
Assert
Lambda 
Await

From


Identifiers in python 
===============

	Ø Identifiers are names  used to identify :- variables, functions and classes

Rules:- 
======

	Ø Must start with a letter or _
	Ø Can not start with a number 
	Ø Can not use special characters expect _
	Ø Case-sensitive

Python indentation 
==============

	Ø Python uses indentation instead of curly braces {}
	Ø Indentation defines code blocks
	Ø Incorrect indentation causes errors
	Ø This makes python code clean and readable 

Comments in python 
===============

Comments are used to 👇

	Ø Explain code
	Ø Improve readability

Types
=====

	Ø Single line : # <comment>
	Ø Multi-line: """ <comment> """

Python app in real world
==================

	Ø Atomate scripts 
	Ø Server monitoring 
	Ø Log analysis 
	Ø Web api's
	Ø Cloud provisioning 
	Ø Ci/cd pipeline


Variables in python
==============

Wt is variable?
===========

	Ø A variable is a named memory location used to store data temporarily during program execution

In python 
=======

	Ø Variables are created automatically 
	Ø No need to declare data type

Python variable syntax
================

Variable_name = value

name = M murali Mohan

name = india

age = 29

Salary = 50000

Python Data Types
==============

	Ø Python provides built-in data types to store different kinds or data

	1. Integer (int)
=============

	Ø To store whole numbers 

Age = 29
Count = 29
States = 29
Ut = 8

	2. Floating point (float)
===================

	Ø To store decimal values 

Price = 95.45
Temperature = 36.5

	3. String (str)
===========

	Ø To store text or character 

Name = "murali"
Role = 'DevOps Trainer'
Company = '''clahan tech'''  or """clahan tech"""

	4. Boolean (bool)
===============

	Ø To store true or fasle

Is_active = true
Is_admin = false


a = 10
b = 5
print (a > b)
print ( a < b)
print (a == b)
print (a != b)


	5. Complex number 
================

	Ø To store real value and imaginary value

A + bj

Z = 3+4j


z = 6+8j
print(z)
print(z.real)
print(z.imag)

	6. List 
=======

	Ø To store a set of values and 


Characteristics of list
===============

Ordered:- items  keep the order or position in which they are inserted
Mutable:- you can change , add or remove items
Allow duplicates:- same value can appear multiple time
Can store different data types :- int, float, string, list ,boolean etc


fruits = ["apple", "banana", "mango"]
marks = [80, 75, 90]
mixed = [1, "python", 3.5, True ]
print(fruits)
print(marks)
print (mixed)



fruits = ["grpaes", "mango", "apple"]
print (fruits[0])
print (fruits[1])
print(fruits[2])

	7. Tuple 
========
	Ø To a collection of multiple values
	Ø Items will  in ordered 
	Ø Immutable 
	Ø Allows duplicate values
	Ø Define using parentheses ()


fruits = ("apple", "banana", "mango")
score = (287, 276, 49, 153)
mixed = ("banana", 287, 49.25, False)
print(fruits)
print(score)
print (mixed)



numbers = (10, 20, 30, 40, 50)
print(numbers[1:3])
print(numbers[2:])
print(numbers[1:4])

    8. Set
======

    Ø A set in python is an unordered collections of unique elements 
    Ø Stores only unique values
    Ø No duplicate elements 
    Ø Unordered 
    Ø Mutable :- can add/remove items

Why it is?
=======

    Ø We want to remove duplicates 
    Ø We don't care about order
    Ø We need fast membership checking
    Ø We want mathematical operations 

Characteristics of set
===============

    Ø No ordered
    Ø No index
    Ø won't allow  duplicate items
    Ø Mutable 
    Ø Support math oprts


numbers = (10, 20, 30, 40, 50)
print(numbers[1:3])
print(numbers[2:])
print(numbers[1:4])


    9. Dictionary 
===========

Key-value pair?
===========

"Name": "murali"

    Ø It will store a collection of data stored as key-value pairs


Why it is?
=======

    Ø Data has a meaningful relationship 
    Ø We want fast lookup using keys
    Ø Data looks like json
    Ø We want to store structured info


Characteristics 
===========

    Ø Data structure:- key -value pair
    Ø Ordered 
    Ø Mutable 
    Ø Keys unique
    Ø Allows Values duplicate


employee = {
    "name": "murali",
    "role": "DevOps Trainer",
    "salary": 50000,
    "name": "clahan"
}
print(employee)
